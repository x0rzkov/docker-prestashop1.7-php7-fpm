This project is based on Alpine Linux, the official nginx image and an nginx module made by Google that provides brotli compression, which also is made by Google.

# How to use this image
As this project is based on the official [nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) look for instructions there. In addition to the standard configuration directives, you'll be able to use the brotli module specific ones, see [here for official documentation](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli#configuration-directives)
